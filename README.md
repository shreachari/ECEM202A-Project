# Breathing Coach
## Abstract

This project aims to create a Breathing Coach app which guides a user through a breathing exercise and provides the user's breathing pattern and feedback in real time. 

To gather breathing data, we use an UWB sensor which is attached to a Raspberry Pi. This data is then sent to an iOS app, using the ZeroMQ Message Queue. We then perform data processing and data analysis to extract meaningful breathing signals and display the waveforms to the screen during the guided meditation. Our goal is to deliver real time feedback to the user during the guided meditation as well.

This project is in collaboration with the NESL Lab and Ph.D. Candidate Ziqi Wang.
